\maketitle
I have designed and built SaaS services from the ground up,
and then maintained and scaled those systems as both the engineering team and user
base grew.
% From this work, many design decisions have led to great outcomes, but
I've learned the most from passive design decisions that plagued the company endlessly. 
For my next role, I plan to apply my expertise to whatever critical
problems are at hand, and continue to grow as an engineer in all ways possible.
\section{Work Experience}
\cventry{Jun 2016 - Present}{Sigma Computing, Inc.}{Software Engineer}{SF,
CA / NYC, New York}{}{ \begin{itemize}
  \item Initial Foundation: Wrote much of the initial application server and feature
    set, also contributing across the stack significantly in all codebases. Key
    features/functionality built include user authentication, users and teams,
    permissions, document filesystem, a task scheduling system for exports and
    other tasks
  \item Enterprise features: designed and built SAML login, OAuth integration
    with warehouses, embedding, and version tagging
  \item Incident response and mitigation: I was critical in triaging,
    understanding, and addressing countless incidents. I also worked to ensure
    that the correct monitoring was in place to alert engineers of incidents as
    they arose, while avoiding false positives and alert fatigue
  \item Reliability and noisy neighbor problems: I worked to ensure the service
    could handle increasingly higher RPS/DAU as customers scaled up.
    Specifically, worked on problems related to MySQL, NodeJS, and
    microservices
\end{itemize}}
